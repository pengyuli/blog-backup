# S3 and CDN
* provides key-value based **object storage** with **unlimited storage**, each file can be from **0 Byte to 5TB**
* Files are store in **Bucket**, S3 bucket names are globally unique namespace
* **durable, highly available, and infinitely scalable** data storage infrastructure at very low costs.
* Have MFA Delete function

### Key Fundamentals of S3
* Key (name of the object)
* Value (data)
* Version ID
* Metadata
* Subresources
	* Access Control List
	* Torrent	 


## Data Consistency For S3
* Read after right consistency for puts of new objects.
* Eventual COnsistency for overwites (PUTS, DELETES)

### S3 storage classes 
1. S3 Standard 
2. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	* 	optimized for long-lived and less frequently accessed data
3. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 
	* stores data in a single AZ
4. S3 Intelligent Tiering
	*  Designed to optimized costs by automatically moving data to most cost-effective tier
5. S3 Glacier 
	* suitable for low cost data archiving, where data access is infrequent
	* Retrieval times can be config from minutes to hours
6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) 
	*  provides lowest cost data archiving, where data access is infrequent
	* provides retrieval time of several (12-48) hours

	
### S3 Encryption	
##### Encryption in Transit is achieved by SSL/TLS
##### Encryption At Rest(Servicer Side)
* SSE-S3 – encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
* SSE-KMS – leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys. KMS provides control and audit trail over the keys.
* SSE-C – when you want to manage your own encryption keys. AWS does not store the encryption key. Requires HTTPS.

### S3 Versioning
* S3 stores all versions of an object (include all writes and even if you delete the object)
* once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled only suspended
* Ingegrates with Lifecycle rules

### S3 Performance
* Prefix: s3Name/prefix/filename.  mytests3/folder1/folder2/abc.jpg Prefix is folder1/folder2
* S3 achieve 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD request per second per **prefix**
* If encrypt with KMS, KMS will have limitation on request number/**region**

### S3 select & Glacier select
* **S3 select** enables your applications to retrieve only a subset of data from an object by using simple SQL expressions. --> Performance increase
* Get data by rows or columns using SQL , save money on data transfer and increase speed



#### AWS Organization
AWS Organization is an account management service that enables you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage

Best Practice:
* always enable mult factor authentication on the root account 
* always use a strong and complex password on the root account 
* The paying account should be used for billing purposes only do not deploy resources into the paying account and the paying account is simply the root account or master account

#### Share S3 bucket accross accounts
1. Using Bucket Policies and IAM(Apply to entire bucket and Programmatic access only)
2. Using Bucket ACLs and IAM(object level and Programmatic access only)
3. Cross account IAM roles

#### Cross Region Replication
1. Versioning must be enable on both source and target buckets
2. File in an existing bucket not auto replicated, new updated files will be auto replicated
3. Delete markers not replicated, deleting individual versions will not replicated


# CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network offered by Amazon Web Services. Content delivery networks provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers which cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, thus improving access speed for downloading the content.


###### Edge Locations
This is the location where content will be cached
###### Origin 
This is the origin of all files that the CDN will distribte
###### Distribution
Distribution: Is the name AWS calls CDN's.

* **Web** distribution is for generic web contents 
* **RTMP** distribution is for video streaming

### Signed URL/Cookies

* Use signed URL/Cookies whe you want to secure the content so only the people you authorize are able to access it
* Signed URL is for individual file
* Signed Cookies is for multiple files


# Athena & Macie
## Athena
* Athena is an interactive query service
* allow to query data in S3 using SQL
* serverless
* Commonly used to analyse log data in S3

## Macie
* Use AI to analyze data in S3 and identify PII
* includes dashboards, reports and laerting


# SnowBall
Snowball is (an appliance) a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses devices designed to be secure to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS Cloud
